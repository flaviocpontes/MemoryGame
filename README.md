# Memory Game Project

This is my project for the Web Front-End Foundations nanodegree from Udacity

## How to play

If the game board is blank, just start clicking the cards. Once a card is clicked, it will show it's symbol.

If a card matches the previous card revealed, both will stay revealed and change color to denote the matching.

Once all cards are matched, the game is over and a popup informs the score and the time it took to finish the game.

## Scoring

Every second card revealed is considered a move.

The scoring is based in the number of moves takes to finish the game and is as follows:

- 3 Stars - Less than 12 moves;
- 2 Stars - Between 12 and 17 moves;
- 1 Star - 18 or more moves;

## Restarting the game

The game can be restarted during the game by clicking on the round arrow above the board or by clicking Yes in the end game popup.
